# Genome_Assembly
Assembling a genome and its resulting contigs
Intro: The purpose of this project was to understand the ability of spades.py to define specific contig length, through plug and play experimentation of the documentation. 
Requirments: spades.py, a linix subsystem (Ubuntu 1804.2019.541 was used), and quast 2.3

Notes: It is important to note that a cluster is not manditory to run or store data, but is very helpful when dealing with 40-50 gb files. The UNCC clusters of Mamba and Copperhead provide 150gb storage and up to 8 requested nodes per active graduate student. This makes it easy to run multiple jobs without occupying your computers gpu and crowding its memory.
